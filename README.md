> This is my take on the practical Android project for a position at UOL.
> All the code here have production-ready quality. Please check details below.

## Why

Because this position at UOL should be mine. Period.

## How

This project leverages on several modern approaches to build Android applications, for instance

- 100% written in Kotlin programming language
- Massive test coverage, including tests at unit and integration levels, using both JVM-local and instrumentation environments 
- Continuous integration (and ready-to-go Continuous Delivery, since we have tests)
- MVVM Architecture powered by Android Architecture Components
- Rock-solid reactive data flows leveraging RxJava2
- Dependency Injection provided by Dagger2, using all the new features (as `ContributesAndroidInjector`)
- ETC

## When (Development Tracking)

Epics, histories and tasks for every single feature of this project are tracked at the following [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/ghpAQrPc/uol-challenge)
