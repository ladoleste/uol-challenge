# UOL Challenge
 
> This is a practical project for a Software Engineer position.
> Please check details below.

## Why

Because this position should be mine ... ðŸ˜¹ðŸ˜¹ðŸ˜¹

## How

This project leverages on several modern approaches to build Android applications :

- 100% written in Kotlin programming language
- Massive test coverage, including tests at unit and integration levels, using both JVM-local and instrumentation environments 
- Continuous integration (and ready-to-go Continuous Delivery)
- Modularization-ready
- MVVM Architecture powered by Android Architecture Components
- Rock-solid reactive data flows leveraging RxJava2

This project is focused on `correctness` of the content experience, both for news feed 
feature and news content screen. 

As a 100% online application, this demo project implements several strategies to deal with most common error 
cases incoming from the Web such and 404, 5xx, 4XY, networking headaches and so on. 
These strategies are applied both for news feed (REST API) and news content (WebView), 
leveraging decoupled presentation behaviors and inversion of control (to data sources)

Note that you must build against the `live` build variant in order to let the app perform real calls to the REST API
